	Fix odd behaviour when setting path without explicitly opening:
	 EntityModel::Log->instance->path('output.log')->min_level(0);
	Also ensure that ->handle returns a handle even when we're reopening.

	RTs fixed:
	* #84342 - disable the new smartmatch warning introduced in perl 5.017.011,
	untested since perlbrew doesn't have that perl version available (yet! apparently
	it should pick it up when http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html has it). Thanks
	to Andreas for finding+reporting.

	API-BREAKING cleanup to method names. If you're using this please note that some camelCase names
	are renamed, hopefully for the better.

	Stack trace is possibly more useful now, uses a fake format string %S entry.

	Stringify blessed objects in stack trace to avoid massive stack trace
	output when deeper objects are on the stack.

	OO methods added, not that I've used them much. Synopsis updated accordingly.

	Also provide some sort of primitive Test::Harness integration, and some examples.

	Use STDERR as the default handle, rather than randomly creating entitymodel.log files.
	Only check handle once in ->close, and move the close-on-fork to a separate
	method which avoids closing unless we're already open.
